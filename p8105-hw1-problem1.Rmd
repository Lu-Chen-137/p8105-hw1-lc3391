#problem 1 

```{r problem1-hw1}
library(tidyverse)

la_df= tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(8),
  norm_samp_pos = norm_samp > 0,
)

mean_samp = mean(pull(la_df, norm_samp))

```

The mean of the sample is `r mean(pull(la_df, norm_samp))`


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
